# Fish Fusion Group Project

In this project, you are going to build a purchasing pipeline for a bargain fish restaurant in your city.

There are 3 different actors in this system, and you will write functions in multiple modules of code to have them share data, and in the end, the restaurant will make its final purchases.

Your coaches will provide each team with a link to get the project code and guide you through how to get started using Github Classroom.
