# Data Structure: The Queue

Food processing facility to produce consumer goods.

## Queue Intro

Similar to Stack, Queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed for storing data. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). One can imagine a queue as a line of people waiting to receive something in sequential order which starts from the beginning of the line. It is an ordered list in which insertions are done at one end which is known as the rear and deletions are done from the other end known as the front. A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
