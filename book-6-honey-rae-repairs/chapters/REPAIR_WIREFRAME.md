# Planning Honey Rae Repairs

## ðŸ“º Watch The Video
Take a few minutes to watch the [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/0eCYAQJNAUk) of the [Honey Rae Repairs wireframe](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMucRFUc=/?share_link_id=556612065166).

## Building Your Capstone Wireframe
Once you're ready to put together your capstone proposal, you will be required to provide a wireframe representing all the views of your application. At that time, you can revisit this chapter and use the [Honey Rae Repairs wireframe](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMucRFUc=/?share_link_id=556612065166) as an example of what to build.

Building a wireframe is an important part of the planning process. It forces you to think about the flow of your user experience, identifies each route of your application, and gives you a visual representation of every component in your application. Having a well fleshed out wireframe will help you break down the whole of your application into smaller and more manageable tasks and ultimately speed up the development process.

### Your wireframe should:
1. Represent each MVP view of your application
2. Represent each MVP feature of your application
3. Be readable and easy to understand

### Adding links
Links make your wireframe interactive and easier to understand. Adding links in your wireframe is easy with [Miro](https://miro.com/)
