# Displaying All The Posts
In this chapter you will implement the following user story for the ***[All Posts](./LEARN_WIREFRAME.md#-homeall-posts)*** view:

**Given** the user wishes to view a list of all the posts<br>
**When** the user is at the home route or visits the All Posts view<br>
**Then** the ***title***, ***topic*** and ***number of likes*** will display for each post in the database. 

## Getting started

Begin by creating a new component for `AllPosts`. A `components` and `services` directory have been provided for you. The rest of your file structure is up to you. The first user story mentions the `home route`. Don't worry about this for now, we'll introduce routes in Part 3 of this book. For the time being, render your `AllPosts` component in the `App` component, the same way we have done with `CustomerList` and `EmployeeList` in Honey Rae Repairs. 


The layout and theme is entirely up to you! Go all out, or keep it simple. Just make it clean and tidy (_hello flexbox!_)

## Optional Fun!
Tired of writing CSS? Check out this [explorer chapter](./EXPLORE_CSS.md) about CSS libraries! ⚠️**EXPLORER BEWARE**⚠️ These libraries can have a bit of a learning curve. You can always try them out later or use them in your capstone if you're not ready to take on something new.
