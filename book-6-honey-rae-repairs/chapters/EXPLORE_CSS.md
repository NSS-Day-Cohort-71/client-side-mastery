# CSS Libraries
If only there were some third party library that could make my app look great without me having to write hundreds of lines of css...

Well guess what... ***There is!!***
In fact, there's _tons_ of 'em! In this chapter, you will find several links to CSS frameworks that work well with React, however you'll have to read the documentation (an important skill to develop) to learn how to incorporate them into your application. Some are pretty simple to plug and play, others take a bit of reading to understand.

If you'd like to incorporate one in your application, take a look at some of the popular options below:

## Tailwind CSS
Tailwind is a library of of classes you can add to your components. It's possible to use Tailwind in combination with one of the libraries below! [Click here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to get started with Tailwind.

## Radix
Radix is a library of styled components, such as buttons, inputs, cards, and more. Import them into your own components to build your UI! If you'd like to add some custom styles to these components, add some classes you've written or use Tailwind!
