# Displaying the Customer's Tickets
In this chapter, you'll implement the Tickets view for a customer. A customer should _only_ see the tickets they've created, each ticket should have a button to delete, and the customer should see different buttons for filtering than an employee. 

## ðŸ“º Watch the videos
Watch the [Customer Tickets](https://youtu.be/BQ_Q1R6uo9c?si=b9sMQTChwa7DiTl6) video and implement the code to display only the customer's tickets yourself. Take a break and then watch the [Customer Ticket Buttons](https://youtu.be/z77fsw-ZKLc?si=A_YmL5ovakc9flmL) video and implement the code for the new buttons yourself.
