# The Plan
This application will have several views, and just like in Honey Rae Repairs, you will begin to build these views piece by piece. Before you get started, however, having an end product in mind will help with your decision making process as you build. _What components will you build? What will your routes be? What components can you reuse?_ Some guidance will be given for these decisions and others will be left up to you.

Below is a list of user stories describing every feature you will implement in this project. Carefully read the user stories for each view of this application, then, build a wireframe representing each view and its features. Of course, feel free to review your wireframe with an mentor when you are finished.


Revisit the [Honey Rae's Wireframe](REPAIR_WIREFRAME.md#building-your-capstone-wireframe) chapter for guidance on building this wireframe.

### The Nav Bar
A navbar will persist in each view, allowing the user to navigate through the views of the application. The links on the navbar are as follows:
  1. **All Posts** > links to the view of all the posts
  2. **My Posts** > links to the view of the logged in user's posts
  3. **Favorites** > links to the view of the logged in user's liked posts
  4. **New Post** > links to the view of the new post form
  5. **Profile** > links to the view of the logged in user's profile
  6. **Logout** > will logout the user
