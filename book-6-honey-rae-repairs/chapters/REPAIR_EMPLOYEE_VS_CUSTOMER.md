# Employee Views vs Customer Views
In this chapter, you'll create two separate sets of routes: one for Employees and one for Customers. You'll then render them conditionally based on whether the logged-in user is a staff member or not.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on the video: 
This video instructs you to make the files`views/CustomerViews.js` and `views/EmployeeViews.js`. Make sure your files end in `.jsx` instead of `.js`.

Watch the [Employee vs Customer](https://youtu.be/1tPVJxW9Uus?si=HtBSPGHrlWqRXqdX) video and implement the code yourself.
