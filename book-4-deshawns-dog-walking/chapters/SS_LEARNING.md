Time to grow your Learning Efficiency. Search the Web to find the answer to the following questions. Successfully implementing the knowledge that you find is a nice bonus, but is not the ultimate goal.

    > Each dock will only service some of the hauling ships because of contracts with their companies. For example, Rotterdam will only service "Seawise Giant" and "Pioneering Spirit", and Busan will service "Seawise Giant" and "Boaty McBoatface".

4. What is `structuredClone()` in JavaScript, and how could it be used in your project?
