# Shipping Ship Haulers Around The World

In this project, you are going to be displaying 3 lists of information.

1. A list of major cargo ships in service today _(shipping ships)_ that transport goods across international waters.
2. A list of ship haulers currently in service _(shipping ship ships)_ that carry cargo ships to different major docks in the world.
3. A list of major docks that load and unload shipping ships to the hauling ships.

## Requirements

* Each cargo ship can be assigned to a single hauler ship, and a hauler can carry multiple cargo ships.
* Each hauler can be assigned to a single, major dock. A dock can be unloading, or loading, several haulers at the same time.
* Every ship has a name property.
* Docks have their location _(i.e. "City, Country")_ as a string property.
* Docks have their maximum capacity, in millions of tons, as a decimal property.

## ERD

Given those requirements, design an ERD in dbdiagram that fulfills them correctly.
