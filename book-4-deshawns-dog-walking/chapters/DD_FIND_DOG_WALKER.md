# Navigating ERD Relationships

In this chapter, you will continue to use data attributes to embed more state into the DOM than is visible to the users. When a pet is clicked, the goal is to show the person walking the dog.

Since those two bits of information are in different arrays, you will need to access state that is stored in the DOM, and then use that state to find a related object in a different array.
