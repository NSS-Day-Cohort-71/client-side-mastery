# Band Member Bios

In this options Explorer chapter, you are going to update your ERD, database, and implementation logic to display detailed information about each member of a band.

## Data Requirements

Store the following information in your database about each band member.

* First name
* Last name
* Year born
* Role in band _(e.g. lead singer or drummer)_
* Band

Should any of those fields above be a foreign key? If so, which one?

## Display Requirements

Currently, when you click on a band, your display any venues for which they are booked. You need to update that to display the information about each band member before the venue list in the alert box.

```txt
Gail McDermott (lead singer)
Chad Wilson (guitar)
Melanie Hobson (bass)
Greg Broadstreet (drummer)

Upcoming shows:
Cellar Moss
Flint Rock Cafe
