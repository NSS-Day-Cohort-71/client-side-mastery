# Feature List

## Tour Venues

1. At the bottom of the page, the name of each venue should be displayed in a bulleted list.
2. When a venue name is clicked, a window alert should be presented to the user that displays all of the bands that have booked the venue.

## Bands

1. At the bottom of the page, to the right of the venue list, the name of each band should be displayed in a bulleted list.
2. When a band name is clicked, a window alert should be presented to the user that displays all of the venue at which the band is playing.

## Bookings

1. Above the venue list and band name list, you should display all of the bookings that Samantha Ducarte has helped the bands make at each venue.
   #### Example Booking Text

   ```txt

   ````
2. When a booking is clicked, a window alert should be presented to the user that displays all of the band information (name, genre, year formed, number of members).


   #### Example Booking Alert Text

   ```txt
   Rocket Pumpkins

## Algorithmic Thinking Reminder

It is crucial, therefore, that you work on designing the algorithm before you write **any** code. This involves two steps.

### Step 1: Analytical Thinking

1. Which modules should you create?
1. What is the responsibility of each module?
1. What functions should be in which modules?
1. What is the responsibility of each function?
1. What should each function return?

### Step 2: Algorithmic Thinking

1. In which order should you invoke your functions?
2. What data do you need to get from your database when an event listener is triggered?
3. In what order should the data be navigated with `for..of` loops?
4. What is the spcific algorithm for each function? Does the function need parameters? Should it return something?

### Step 3: Visualize the Solution

1. Draw a dependency graph
2. Draw a sequence diagram

Do all of this before you write a single line of code, or you could end up wasting hours of time writing code only to find that you need to throw it all away because you didn't design the algorithm first.
