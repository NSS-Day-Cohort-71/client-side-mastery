# Displaying All Submissions

In this chapter you will be creating a new component to display all of the submissions in your UI. You're not going to start off with anything fancy - just the bare bones to get some initial data in the browser.

Create a new module in your project named `Submissions.js` and start off with the following code for your component function.

```js
export const SubmissionList = async () => {
    // Get the submissions from your API


    // Iterate the submissions and create some <section> representations


    // Return the HTML string
}
```

Once you complete the component function, you will invoke it from the main module and then compose that HTML into the overall UI.

Can you implement the code for this feature before you watch the video? Give it a shot. If you get stuck, watch the video for a walkthrough.
