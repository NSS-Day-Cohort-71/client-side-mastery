# First Fetch

In this chapter, you will make your first HTTP request in JavaScript using the `fetch()` function. You will be requesting data from the [Random Fox API](https://publicapis.io/random-fox-animals-api) so dynamically update the content of the DOM with a random fox image.

We also suggest that you bookmark the [Public APIs site](https://publicapis.io/) for use later on in the course, and possibly for use for your capstone project.

## Overview of Fetch and DevTools

Watch **Fox y Dog First Fetch** video for an overview of making remote Web requests with `fetch()`. When you are done with the video, implement the code yourself.
