## Overview

You will be building an application for a local food truck that offers food that is a fusion of American Southern and Greek cuisines.

A customer should be able to choose a base dish, a vegetable, and a side dish and place their order. Once the order is placed, the total amount for the chosen foods will appear at the bottom.
