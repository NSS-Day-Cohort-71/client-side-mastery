# Second Fetch

In this chapter, you are going to request an image of a cat from the URL provided below, and then update the `src` attribute of the image element once you get the data back.

Instead of using a `fetch().then()` chain, you will use the syntactical sugar of `async/await`.

```txt

```

Watch a video on how the response data is slightly different from the previous chapter and update the DOM correctly.
