# Meeting Dr. Henrietta Jones - Urbanologist

Dr. Henrietta Jones is a prominent urbanologist who works for the University of Indianapolis. When she is not working on her regular coursework of teaching classes about urbanology and the history of urban life in the United States, she is out in the field trying to find lost artifacts from ancient, or abandoned, cities of the US.

Unfortunately, Dr. Jones is required, every year, to do research work and publish papers on her work in order to keep her good standing with the university. Her most recent research involves understanding the relationship of the history of the blue jean with the rise of the urban lifestyle.

To start, she's going to send a survey to students at all Indiana universities, her's included, to collect data on if the student owns a pair a blue jeans, the cost of the garment, and if the student lives in an urban or rural area.

She calls the study **"Indiana Jeans"**.

She wants you to design the survey as a web application so that students can have a web page to go to.

## Project Setup

Create the following directory and files.

```sh
mkdir ~/workspace/indiana-jeans
cd ~/workspace/indiana-jeans
mkdir styles scripts api
touch index.html styles/main.css scripts/main.js api/database.json
```

Then open the directory in Visual Studio Code.

Use the `!` shortcut to get a starter HTML document. Use the `link` helper to get your CSS linked and use a `<script>` tag to include your `main.js` module.

Then go to the next chapter learn about JSON Server.
