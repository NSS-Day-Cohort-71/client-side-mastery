# JSON Server - Your First API Server

In this project, you will be using `fetch()` to request data for your application, but rather than requesting data from somewhere else on the Web, you will request it from your own computer. The `json-server` terminal application makes this happen.

**json-server** works like the `serve` application, but instead of being a simple web server that sends HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files is response to a request, it will send chunks of JSON in response to requests.

## Starting json-server

Make sure you are in the `api` directory of your Kneel Diamonds project. Then run the following command to start your API server.

```sh
json-server database.json -p 8080
```
