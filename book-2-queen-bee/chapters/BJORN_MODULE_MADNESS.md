# A Module For Each Display

In your project, you still very likely have all of the display code in the `bjorn.js` module.

1. The ASCII art banner at the top
2. Information about trails
3. Information about rivers

In this Explorer chapter, your challenge is to move each of these chunks of display logic into their own module, and their own function in those modules. Then import each into `bjorn.js` and invoke the appropriate functions there.
