# Helping Customers Find The Right Trails Package

BjÃ¶rn and his team have discovered from customer feedback that people would like to see a breakdown of the the least expensive trail tours and most expensive. He would like you to update the program to produce output simliar to what is shown below.

For the least expensive, only show trails where the number of dollar signs in the price is 1.

For the most expensive, only show trails where the number of dollar signs in the price is 4, or greater.

> **Note:** Once you get the correct trails being shown, you might discover a bug in the data, and you need to track it down.
