# Visualizing the Project

## Dependency Graph

First, create a dependency graph to visualize the decisions you made for this project - whether you chose to modularize by resource, or by functionality. Start with the BjÃ¶rn module, look at what it imports, and go from there.

## Sequence Diagram

Second, draw a sequence diagram that displays the algorithm for this project. Make sure you have a step in the sequence for every import, every loop _(wherever the loop happens)_.

Here is an example to get started. Yours may not look like this at all, it's just one possibility.

```mermaid

    participant Data
    participant Bjorn
    participant Rivers
    Bjorn->>Data: May I please have all the trail data?
    Data-->>Bjorn: Sure! Here you go.
    note over Bjorn: Iterate some data to do a thing
```
