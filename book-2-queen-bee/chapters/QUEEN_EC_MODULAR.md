# Modular Queen Code

Now that you have practiced the skill of modularizing code with the Core Projects of this book, go back to your **Her Majesty** project and modularize the code so that it is not all in the `main.js` module.

* Create a module to contain all of the data and then export those variables at the bottom with `module.exports`.
* Create a module to contain all of the functions and then export them at the bottom with `module.exports`.
* Import the data and the functions into the modules that need them and get to the point where running `main.js` produces the correct output.
