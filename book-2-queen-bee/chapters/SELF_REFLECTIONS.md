# Self Reflections

## Debugging

1. How do you explain the purpose of breakpoints, and what can you learn by using them?
2. Explain the benefits of using the debugger for someone learning the basics of software development.
3. How does a call stack help a developer focus on code that is incorrect?
4. What is the purpose of "stepping through" your code when using the debugger?

## Data Types and Variables

1. What are the key differences between a JavaScript object and a JavaScript array?
3. Why is it important to use variables in programming, and what could be the consequences of not using them properly?
4. Can you explain the importance of variables when trying to understand code written by someone else?
5.  How would you explain the concept of a breakpoint to someone who has never programmed before?
6.  Why might you choose to use an object to represent data rather than a series of individual variables?
7.  Why is it important to understand the data type of the value that you are working with in your project?

## Iteration

1. In what situations would you use a `for..of` loop?
2. How would you explain the difference between `for..of` and `for` loops to someone new to JavaScript?
3. Describe how you would use a `for..of` loop to iterate over an array and modify the elements it contains.
4. What are the two variables needed when you define a `for..of` loop?

## Functions

1.  What are the advantages of using functions in your code?
2. How do you differentiate between when a function is defined and when it is invoked in your code?
3. What is the role of parameters within functions, and how do they enhance a function's capabilities?
4. In your own words, what does it mean to pass a value to a function as an argument?
5.  In what way do you think understanding the difference between parameter and argument can help in debugging a function that is not working as expected?
6.  Explain why a function that works correctly with one set of arguments might not work with another. How would you go about troubleshooting this?
7.  Describe an error you encountered while writing a JavaScript function. How did you solve it, and what did you learn from the experience?
8. Reflect on a time when you used a function parameter to change the outcome of your function. Why was the parameter necessary?

## Logic

1. How do you use an `if` statement to make decisions in your code, and can you give an example of a boolean condition?
3.  Describe how an `if` statement could control the flow in a program that simulates a traffic light. What would the boolean conditions represent?

## Formatting

1. How would you convince someone of the importance of learning to code with proper indentation and formatting? What difference does it make?
