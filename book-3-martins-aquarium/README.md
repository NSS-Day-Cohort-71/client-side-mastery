| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | [üöú<br/>Modern Farm](../projects/tier-1/modern-farm/README.md) | In this group project, your team is going to build an application that simulates the process of planning, planting, harvesting and selling crops for a modern farming operation. |

## üîê Deep Learning Projects Unlocked

These projects expand your knowledge of data, functions and modules. Each project has tests that run and verify that your code follows the requirements.

| #   | Project Name  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | [The&nbsp;Hairy&nbsp;Potter](../projects/tier-1/hairy-potter/) | This project has very specific requirements for how you should structure and organize your code. Attention to details is very important **before** you write your code. |
