# Terminal Welcome Message

The terminal can do everything that all of your other applications you have, or ever will have, can do. There's just not a visual interface for doing it. It's all just text.

In this challenge, you should research bash variables, bash aliases, and find out how to customize your `zsh` _(.zshrc)_ or `bash` _(.bashrc)_ initialization script to have a welcome message show up every time your launch a terminal session.
